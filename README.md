# A fork of the Stable Diffusion Cog model that outputs tileable images for use in 3D applications such as [Monaverse](https://monaverse.com)

This is an implementation of the [Diffusers Stable Diffusion 1.4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) as a Cog model. [Cog packages machine learning models as standard containers.](https://github.com/replicate/cog)

First, download the pre-trained weights [with your Hugging Face auth token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens):

    cog run script/download-weights <your-hugging-face-auth-token>

Then, you can run predictions:

    cog predict -i prompt="Stone wall trimsheet, quixel, substance designer, trending on artstation"
    
 Output:
 ![output](https://bafybeidpchqv4yoaxx7ik2i2bhb2yueflgx7rsgr6hu5aeifspvkt2znam.ipfs.w3s.link/output.0.png)

Or, build a Docker image:

    cog build

Or, [push it to Replicate](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/push-a-model):

    cog push r8.im/...
